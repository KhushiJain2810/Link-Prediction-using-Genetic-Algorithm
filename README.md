# Link-Prediction-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Improving Link Prediction in Social Network using Genetic Algorithm.

### Problem Statement
Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the rating given by a user to a particular movie. Genetic Algorithm was applied to find an optimized topology of ANN to improve the prediction.

### What is Link Prediction?
Link prediction in social network analysis is used to analyze existing links and predict future links among millions of users of social network. It is used to find people for a certain job profile, in bioinformatics to discover interactions between proteins, in security to monitor terrorist groups andin recommendation systems.
